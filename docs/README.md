ElChino is an interactive chatbot that helps you manage your tasks. 

ElChino is able to keep track of 3 types of tasks:
1. Todos
2. Deadlines with a due date
3. Events with a start and end date

Users can add, delete, and mark/unmark tasks as done.

# Quick Start
The jar file elchino.jar can be run from any directory. But make sure that elchino.jar is in the same folder as the data folder which contains tasks.txt - to load your saved tasks. If new user, the program will generate the data folder.

Steps to execute elchino.jar:
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the directory containing elchino.jar
3. Run the command `java -jar elchino.jar`

To exit elchino.jar, type `bye` and press Enter. Next, close the dialog box by clicking the X in the upper right corner of the window.
